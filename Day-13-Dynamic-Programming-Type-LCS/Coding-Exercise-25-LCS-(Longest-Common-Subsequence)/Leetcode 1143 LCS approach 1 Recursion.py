#Leetcode-1143-Longest-Common-Subsequence-approach-1-Recursion
"""Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

â€¢For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

Example: 

Input: text1 = "pbcdq", text2 = "pcq" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "pcq" and its length is 3."""
