"""Determine how to optimally fill a knapsack with a capacity of W kilograms using a list of N items, where each item is represented by a pair [profit, weight]. In the Fractional Knapsack problem, you can take fractions of items to maximize the total profit in the knapsack.(N will be greater than equal to 1 )

Example 1:

Given arr[] = [[70, 10], [90, 20], [150, 30]]

W= 25

Expected output = 145



Example 2:

Given arr[] = [[70, 10], [90, 20], [150, 30]]

W= 45

Expected output = 242.5"""
