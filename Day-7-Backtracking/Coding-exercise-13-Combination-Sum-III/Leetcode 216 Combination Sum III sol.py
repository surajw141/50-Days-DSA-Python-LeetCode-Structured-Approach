"""Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:

Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.

Each number is used at most once.

Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

Example :

Input: k = 3, n = 6
Output: [[1,2,3]] 
Explanation:
1 + 2 + 3 = 6
There are no other valid combinations.
