"""Given a set of N items, each with a weight and a value, represented by the array w and val respectively. Also, a knapsack with weight limit W.

The task is to fill the knapsack in such a way that we can get the maximum profit. Return the maximum profit.

Note: Each item can be taken any number of times.



Input: 
N = 2
W = 3
val = [4, 2]
wt = [3, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
1.Pick the 2nd element thrice.
So, Total value = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. and the total weight = 1 + 1 + 1  = 3 
which is <= 3."""
