"""Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.


Example :

Input: s = "jackson", wordDict = ["jack","son"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "jackson" can be segmented as "jack son"."""
